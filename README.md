# Battleship
Just a simple monkey-coded battleship game
* Drag'n'Drop and auto-layout modes
* Drag holding CTRL of ALT to rotate the ship
* Easy and hard modes
* Last chosen modes are saved in the local storage
* Neighboring sectors of killed ships are automatically marked out
* Killed ships are stroke out of the list
